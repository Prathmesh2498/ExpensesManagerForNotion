A simple application add expenses in the default expense manager template in Notion.

This is a simple application to add your expense to the Notion expense manager database that is created by default.
The string you input in the form "Expense,Amount,Comment,Tag", date is added automatically.
The 'Tag' can take value only from the currently existing tags in the database. If you want to create a new tag, create it through notion first,
and then use it in this app.
The reason I created this app is I wanted to add expenses quickly like taking a not in Google Keep ot Evernote, but have it formatted in the way
Notion does. The mobile version in Notion makes it a bit complicated as you have to add each field in the new page that opens when you add a new entry.
If you use Notion to manage your expenses and want a simple way to add an expense then this app is for you! Enjoy!

I have written a blog about how this app works.

This app is also open-sourced on github.
This is my first app on the playstore and I am the sole devloper hence this is very much in beta phase.
I will keep improving it continuously based on feedback I get.
