# ExpensesManagerForNotion
A simple app to add new records to the deafult expense manager template in Notion.

This is a completely open sourced project. I built it because of my personal needs.
If you want to use this application download from the playstore here: 
Or you can also install it from android studio.

What I would help with?
  1. Front end. Designing UI is not my strong suit.
  2. Icon for the application. A logical implication after 1 :P
